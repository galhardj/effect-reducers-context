# useEffect
Put anything referred inside a useEffect as its dependency (i.e. only when the dependency is required)

These are what this program will do:

 - It will show from the console that the program will keep *Cleaning up* everytime we input any character to the input fields.
 - every once in a while (e.g. 500 ms) after any character input, the validation of either email/password inputted will be checked automatically. It is indicated by printing *Checking form validity* to the console.
